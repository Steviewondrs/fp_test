# fp test

This small project was per request to test my skills and was made in a matter of days (hence the simple look and feel of the app.)

After installing the dependencies, run the 'dev' command to run the app locally.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

# Nice to have
- Better authentication flow.
- Loading indicators
- Default State
- More Animations
- Detailed overview for itinerary
- Unit tests

# Bugs/Notes
- Refresh view after itinerary is loaded. Workaround: go back and forth on the page once.
- Data loaded from iRail is based on assumptions and the first result of the response is used for rendering.
More testing is needed to make corrections.
